  # Implementation Notes
  #
  # We don't use `environment.etc` because this would require that the user manually delete
  # `/etc/pam.d/sudo` which seems unwise given that applying the nix-darwin configuration requires
  # sudo. We also can't use `system.patchs` since it only runs once, and so won't patch in the
  # changes again after OS updates (which remove modifications to this file).
  #
  # As such, we resort to line addition/deletion in place using `sed`. We add a comment to the
  # added line that includes the name of the option, to make it easier to identify the line that
  # should be deleted when the option is disabled.

        Enable sudo authentication with Touch ID.

        When enabled, this option adds the following line to
        {file}`/etc/pam.d/sudo`:

        ```
        auth       sufficient     pam_tid.so
        ```

        ::: {.note}
        macOS resets this file when doing a system update. As such, sudo
        authentication with Touch ID won't work after a system update
        until the nix-darwin configuration is reapplied.
